# sports_scraping
Web scraping homework involving sports stats

The objective of this assignment was to create a django app that does real time scraping of nfl.com to give back player data.

The requirements of the assignment were as follows:
- Proxy requests from your site to an external resource
- Scrape HTML data with Beautiful Soup and parse out important elements
- Explore methods to optimize the performance of your site

NFL.com has a database of current and historical data available for players in their system. Your task is to reverse engineer their search functionality so that you can use your own site to search for a particular player's data. Clean up the individual stats or bring back the entire HTML structure and display it on your page.

This assignment was completed using Python, Django, Python requests library, and BeautifulSoup.
